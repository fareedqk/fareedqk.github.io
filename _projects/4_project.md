---

The facial expression recognition system uses **deep learning** to analyze facial images and classify them into distinct emotional categories. The dataset for training the model includes thousands of labeled images representing various emotions. The architecture of the model involves **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, which specialize in image-based tasks. After training the model, it can predict emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and fear with a high level of accuracy.

This research project represents the cutting edge of facial recognition technologies, aiming to improve human-computer interaction by enabling machines to better understand human emotions.
