Gynae Genius is an intelligent system designed to provide personalized support for women's health using the latest advancements in AI. It utilizes **LangFlow** for workflow orchestration and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to enhance the accuracy and relevancy of the responses. By integrating **Cohere's NLP API**, Gynae Genius delivers precise, context-aware health information and advice.

The system is designed to respond to a wide variety of queries related to gynecology, offering users reliable, real-time assistance. The project was developed during an international hackathon, where it secured 3rd place. Future improvements include expanding its knowledge base and further refining the conversational experience for users.
