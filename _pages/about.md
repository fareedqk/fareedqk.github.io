Hello, Fareed this side. I love bringing practical innovation to simplify everyday tasks. I am a final year undergraduate student. My research focuses on connecting the realms of visual and textual information, particularly through selfsupervised learning techniques.

With a solid grip on Flutter framework, I have developed a wide range of mobile applications for both iOS and Android platforms, delivering intuitive user experiences and robust functionality. I am always eager to take on new challenges and collaborate on exciting projects in the mobile app development and AI industry.
