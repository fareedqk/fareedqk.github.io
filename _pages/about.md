Hello, Fareed this side. I love bringing practical innovation to simplify everyday tasks. I am a final year undergraduate student. My research focuses on connecting the realms of visual and textual information, particularly through selfsupervised learning techniques.

I am a recent Computer Science graduate with a focus on machine learning and deep learning. Through my academic projects, including a facial expression recognition system, I have developed a strong foundation in data analysis and algorithm development. I am proficient in Python and experienced with libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.

I am eager to apply my knowledge to meaningful projects in the AI field and am committed to continuous learning. I work well in teams and can effectively communicate complex concepts.

My goal is to contribute to innovative solutions that address real-world challenges in technology.
